## BigFlow Suite: Performance analysis and scheduling for distributed scientific workflows
<!-- BigFlow Tools -->

* [DataLife](https://github.com/pnnl/datalife): DataLife is a measurement and analysis toolset for distributed scientific workflows that use I/O and storage for task composition.

* [TAZeR](https://github.com/pnnl/tazer): TAZeR (Transparent Asynchronous Zero-copy Remote I/O) is a remote I/O framework for transparently minimizing the access latencies of remote I/O in workflows.

* [BigFlowSim](https://gitlab.pnnl.gov/perf-lab/tazer/tazer-bigflow-sim): BigFlowSim is a workflow I/O simulator-emulator and trace generator that captures several parameters that affect local and remote I/O performance.


## Application performance analysis and prediction

  * [MemGaze](https://github.com/pnnl/memgaze): MemGaze is a memory analysis toolset that combines high-resolution trace analysis and low overhead measurement, both with respect to time and space.

  * [QuaL¬≤M (QuaLM)](https://github.com/pnnl/qualm): Quantitative Learned Latency Model
  [[Extra datasets]](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/qualm-data)

  * [Palm](https://gitlab.pnnl.gov/perf-lab/palm/): Palm is a suite of performance modeling tools (Palm, Palm-Task, Representative-Paths, Palm/FastFootprints, MIAMI-NW) to assist performance analysis and predictive model generation.

  [Scientific workflows suite (new)](https://gitlab.com/perflab-exact/workflows)

* [SEAK Suite](https://github.com/pnnl/seak): The SEAK Suite is a collection of constraining problems for common embedded computing challenges.

* [PERFECT Suite](https://github.com/pnnl/perfect): The PERFECT Suite consists of kernels and applications for evaluating tradeoffs between performance, power, and architecture within the domains of radar and image processing.

* [miniVite-x](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/minivite-x): Mini-application to demonstrate different memory patterns and test memory analysis tools.
