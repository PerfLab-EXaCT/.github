## [BigFlow Suite](https://gitlab.com/perflab-exact/bigflow-suite): Performance analysis and scheduling for distributed scientific workflows
<!-- BigFlow Tools -->

* [DataLife](https://github.com/pnnl/datalife):
The combination of ever-growing scientific datasets and distributed workflow complexity creates I/O performance bottlenecks due to data volume, velocity, and variety. DataLife is a measurement and analysis toolset for distributed scientific workflows comprised of tasks that interact using files and storage. DataLife performs data flow lifecycle (DFL) analysis to guide decisions regarding coordinating task and data flows on distributed resources. DataLife provides tools for measuring, analyzing, visualizing, and estimating the severity of flow bottlenecks based on I/O and storage.

<!-- * [FlowForecaster](https://github.com/pnnl/flowforecaster): -->

<!-- * [FastFlow](https://github.com/pnnl/fastflow):
When distributed scientific workflows are not intelligently executed, they can fail time constraints. To improve workflow response time, FastFlow is a new method of scheduling and resource assignment based on a monitor-analyze-optimize strategy. The key insight is to use the global perspective of interacting critical flows to guide a fast (locally greedy) scheduler that uses data flow projections to select between the better of flow parallelism and flow locality. Our method is linear time, unlike the next-best methods. -->

* [DaYu](https://github.com/pnnl/DaYu):
The increasing use of descriptive data formats (e.g., HDF5, netCDF) helps organize scientific datasets, but it also creates obscure bottlenecks due to the need to translate high level operations into file addresses and then into low-level I/O operations. DaYu is a method and toolset for analyzing (a) semantic relationships between logical datasets and file addresses, (b) how dataset operations translate into I/O, and (c) the combination across entire workflows. DaYu's analysis and visualization enables identification of critical bottlenecks and reasoning about remediation. With DaYu, one can extract workflow data patterns, develop insights into the behavior of data flows, and identify opportunities for both users and I/O libraries to optimize the applications.

* [TAZeR](https://github.com/pnnl/tazer):
TAZeR (Transparent Asynchronous Zero-copy Remote I/O) is a remote I/O framework for transparently minimizing the access latencies of remote I/O in workflows.

* [BigFlowSim](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/BigFlowSim):
BigFlowSim is a workflow I/O simulator-emulator and trace generator that captures several parameters that affect local and remote I/O performance. The [BigFlowSim Driver](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/BigFlowSim-Driver) is helpful for conducting experiments.

## Distributed AI Services

* [MassiveGNN](https://github.com/pnnl/MassiveGNN): <!-- [(development)](https://github.com/aishwaryyasarkar/Distributed_DGL) -->
    Graph Neural Networks (GNN) based on massively connected (distributed) GNNs pose significant challenges as even with the best methods, GNN training usually suffers from communication bottlenecks and load imbalance. <!-- due to non-determinism -->
    MassiveGNN introduces performant and productive training for massively connected (distributed) GNNs within the state-of-the-art [Amazon DistDGL](https://www.dgl.ai) (distributed Deep Graph Library). It brings practical trade-offs for improving the sampling and communication overheads for representation learning on distributed graphs by developing a parameterized continuous prefetch and eviction scheme.

* [SamIAm](https://github.com/pnnl/SAMIAm): <!-- https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/SamIAm -->
    [(Demo)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PerfLab-EXaCT/SamIAm-LabelStudio/blob/main/SamIAm_Demo.ipynb)
    Image segmentation is a critical enabler for tasks ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous driving. However, the correct segmentation semantics -- where are boundaries located? what segments are logically similar? -- change depending on the domain, such that state-of-the-art foundation models can generate meaningless and incorrect results. Moreover, in certain domains, fine-tuning and retraining techniques are infeasible: obtaining labels is costly and time-consuming; domain images (micrographs) can be exponentially diverse; and data sharing  (for third-party retraining) is restricted. To enable rapid adaptation of the best segmentation technology, we define _semantic boosting_: given a zero-shot foundation model, _guide_ its segmentation and adjust results to match domain expectations. We apply semantic boosting to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain _microstructure segmentation_ for transmission electron microscopy. Our booster, SAM-I-Am, extracts geometric and textural features of various intermediate masks to perform mask removal and mask merging operations.
