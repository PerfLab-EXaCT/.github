## [BigFlow Suite](https://gitlab.com/perflab-exact/bigflow-suite): Performance analysis and scheduling for distributed scientific workflows
<!-- BigFlow Tools -->

* [DataLife](https://github.com/pnnl/datalife): DataLife is a measurement and analysis toolset for distributed scientific workflows that use I/O and storage for task composition.

<!-- * [FastFlow](https://github.com/pnnl/datalife): -->

<!-- * [DaYu](https://github.com/pnnl/datalife): -->

<!-- * [MassiveGNN](https://github.com/pnnl/datalife): -->


* [TAZeR](https://github.com/pnnl/tazer): TAZeR (Transparent Asynchronous Zero-copy Remote I/O) is a remote I/O framework for transparently minimizing the access latencies of remote I/O in workflows.

* [BigFlowSim](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/BigFlowSim): BigFlowSim is a workflow I/O simulator-emulator and trace generator that captures several parameters that affect local and remote I/O performance. The [BigFlowSim Driver](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/BigFlowSim-Driver) is helpful for conducting experiments.


## Application performance analysis and prediction

  * [MemGaze](https://github.com/pnnl/memgaze): MemGaze is a memory analysis toolset that combines high-resolution trace analysis and low overhead measurement, both with respect to time and space.

  * [Palm](https://gitlab.com/perflab-exact/palm): Palm is a suite of performance modeling tools (Palm, Palm-Task, Representative-Paths, Palm/FastFootprints, MIAMI-NW) to assist performance analysis and predictive model generation.

  * [QuaL¬≤M (QuaLM)](https://github.com/pnnl/qualm): Quantitative Learned Latency Model
  [[Extra datasets]](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/qualm-data)

* Interpretation of scientific data streams

    - [SamIAm](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/SamIAm): Semantic segmentation for images from scanning electron microscopy. SamIAm generates precise segments that accord with domain semantics. It is based on semantic tuning of foundation models for general segmentation.

    - [SamIAm-LabelStudio](https://github.com/PerfLab-EXaCT/SamIAm-LabelStudio): A tool to rapidly create precise labels for image segments of identical materials.


* Distributed model training

    - [MassiveGNN](https://github.com/aishwaryyasarkar/Distributed_DGL): Performant and productive training for massively connected (distributed) GNNs within [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai).
  <!-- These GNNs can be distributed on distributed and continuum resources. -->
